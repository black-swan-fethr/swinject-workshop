# Swinject in practive

At [Black Swan Fethr](https://fethr.aero) we hold regular workshops to ourselves so we can improve our knowledge and grow in hard and soft skills.

This repository belongs to a workshop we had about [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject).

The repository has different commits, each commit adds an extra level of difficulty to the DI part of the project.
